            As a Natural Sciences student I have been able to undertake a range of different 
            projects across a range of different topics, however over the last 2 years I have 
            tried to tailor my research to astrophysics topics as that is something I am 
            passionate about and would like to continue research in.

            In Year 2, I had a core module called 'Frontiers in Science 2'
            where I did a range of group projects on different topics, including
            percolation, fractals, and woodlice. 
            As part of the module, I had to do 1 big project over the course of 3 months, 
            where me and my fellow group members carried out an interdisciplinary study on
            'Effects of soil acidification and soil alkalinisation on woodlice behaviour'. 
            We devevloped an experimental methodology to investigate the adaptability of 
            P. Scaber and A. Vulgare to changes in their surrounding pH.
            We did so by using Raspberry Pi and Python to record their clustering patterns
            and then carried out statistical analuysis. 
            We found that P. Scaber are sensitive at pH 6 and below, whereas A. Vulgare can
            adapt to lower pH levels and are less sensitive.

            In Year 3, I went on a study abroad programme to Denmark Technical University, where I did
            the module 'Measurement Technologies in Earth and Space Physics', as part of which
            I undertook a project designing a mission (HADES: Hadesoid Autonomous Deep Electromagnetic 
            Surveyor) to Pluto stemming from the success of New Horizons.
            The aim of the mission was to use different instrumentation targetting three main areas: 
            gravitational field, topography, and magnetic field. 
            We looked at instrumentation used in the previous missions and compared them to see which is best suited
            for Pluto. 
            My focus in the group was determing which altimeter will be the best for the mission and
            I did a comparison between LOLA instrement from the Lunar Renaissance Orbiter and MOLA 
            instrument from the Mars Global Surveyor. 
            I compared the mass, power, wavelength, pulse width, etc of both the instruments to conclude
            the suitability of LOLA for the mission objectives. 
            LOLA was chosen due to its better resolution, and for being half the weight of MOLA, making
            it a better candidate for a three instrument mission.
            Finally, our results were presented in an article style report and a presentation.

            On my study abroad, I also did a module 'Introduction to Bioengineering', where I did a group
            project on designing a biosensor as part of a group. 
            Our group decided to create a biosensor for the 'Detection of concussion based on micro-RNA in the saliva'. 
            The aim was to reduce traffic to ER by providing an at home solution to understand the severity of a concussion.
            The idea involved a use of PCR system inside a sensor that would then draw an intensity profile diagram on your app.
            Results were presented as a report and a presentation.
        </p>

            In Year 3, I chose my Master's project which is designing a probe for the 'Venus Life Finder Missions' which I am 
            carrying into my final year.
            As part of the project I have had the opportunity to develop a range of different skills. 
            I have worked in engineering labs working with mechanical instruments such as electric saw, electric sander, laser cutter,
            etc.
            I have also used the wind tunnel to test my models for their lift and drag values.
            I will be building on my previous design and optimising it for best flight with reduced terminal velocity.
