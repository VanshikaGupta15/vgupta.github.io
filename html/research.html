        <h2>Internship 1</h2>
        <p>
            In Summer 2023, I was selected to be a part of the 'Summer Observational Astrophysics Retreat' (known as SOAR) at the Mount Wilson Observatory.
            I spend 2 weeks learning about the different telescopes in the Observatory and using them to explore a range of different objects in the sky.
            Collaborating with Paula Turner (Professor at Kenyon College), Joh Hoot (Director of SSC Observatories), John Varsik (Solar Astronomer), and Robert K. Buchheim (Plant Manager at Lockheed Martin) was an absolute pleasure and I got to expand my knowledge on a breadth of different topics.
            As part of the retreat, I also undertook a project looking at SS-Cyg to resolve for the Cataclysmic Varibale binary system.
            I used the photometric data to determine the period of ~6 hours which was last measured to be ~6.4 hours over 40 years ago according to the AAVSO data-base. 
            Then by the use of different equations and the magnitude diagram obtained using Large Ensemble Photometry Software, I was able to resolve for the Luminosity, Radius, and Mass of the Secondary (Red Giant) and Primary (White Dwarf) stars.
            I produced a detailed powerpoint and presented my results at the end of the programme to fellow students and staff.

        <h2>Internship 2</h2>
        <p>
            After my Astrophysics retreat at the MWO, I started my itnernship under Dr. Sebastian Marino at the University of Exeter.
            I spent 8 weeks over summer looking at the ALMA data for a debris disk around HD121617, using a tool on Python called Eddy, which was created by Richard Teague (Professor at MIT) to resolve protoplanetary disks. 
            Over the course of my internship I developed the python script in which you can plug in the ALMA data and look at the gas kinematics of the debris disk under observation.
            HS121617 of specific interest to us due to a potential vortex being present in the South West region of the disk; I constrained a range of different parameters and isolated the potential vortex region to see the differences in the velocity profiles.
            As part of interning with the Astrophysics department, I often attended the Disc-cussions which took place every Tuesday where I got to learn how close knit the astro community is and inspires me to apply for a PhD in the same field.
            At the end of my project, I compiled my python scripts into one with details of what each code was doing as a report, and presented my results at the final Disc-cussion to fellow professors and PhD students.
