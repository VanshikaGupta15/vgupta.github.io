            I like to be involved in my community and I do so by being part of societies
            and groups where I can be a voice representing other students.
            My first initiative of this was in 2021/22 academic year where I became a 
            subject representative for Natural Sciences so I can bridge the gap between
            the teaching professionals and my fellow classmates.
            I went to meetings and expressed the co-horts concerns about different topics 
            and what can be done to improve it.

            Furthermore, I became the social secretary for the SpaceExe society for the 
            academic year 2023/23 so I can share my passion for space with likeminded 
            people.
            As part of my role, I organise star gazing nights and plan socials, especially
            the big dinners, ie christmas and summer.
            I also reach out to other societies like Natural Sciences and PhotoSoc to do 
            collaborative events.
            I am currently in contact with the PhotoSoc to organise an astrophotography 
            competition for the staff and students.

            I am currently an Ecliptic Writer volunteer with the UKSEDS - UK space 
            exploration and development for students. 
            I am in charge of concisely writing the posts for the newsletter that is then
            delivered to over 3000 subscribers.

            My interest of Space has allowed me to attend multiple conferences and present
            at various different events.
            In October 2023 I presented at the Women in Physics event about my internship, and
            have recently started hosting the SpaceBar afterparties in collaboration with 
            AstroAgency and UKSEDS. 
            In November 2023, I will be the attending the Global MilSatCom in London where I 
            hope to network with many different people.
